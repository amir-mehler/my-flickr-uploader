Database
--------
Key-Value store. Key is hash sum of the photo. Value is the Flickr photo id. So
far, it's gonna be 256 files (16^2) by two first chars of the hash hex digest.

I should probably check out GDBM or http://propublica.github.io/daybreak/

1. When uploading, we first successfully upload the photo
   and only then store the photo id and hash.

2. When checking all photos in flickr, we get the photo id
   and then look for it in the db.

3. When a photo is deleted from flicker we won't be uploading
   it again since it's already in db. This is the desired behavior.
