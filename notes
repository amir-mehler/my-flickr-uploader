Work:
-----

2. start uploading masses of photos
3. upload the DB to github as long as it's under 50M
5. duplicates; what if the fix_index finds the same md5sum twice?
6. duplicates; check all photos in flickr and report duplicates (by tags)
7. trollop for bin files
8. cross account duplicate prevention - look in other DBs as well.
9. hard code:   api_key: 6b3bdebf50c0a624eb7ec35c5acf2d8f && shared_secret: 4bb9d1f00accca46
  As they are part of the application, not user details. and you can also hide the user token from the user, he should just provide his name.
10. Add 'uploaded-from' tag (base dir and host)

Wishlist
--------
Fix for 'no-date'
- Check photo name and look for sqeuntial photos with data
- Check for similar tags (if first check failed)
Params for fix index:
- ignore existing tags
- ignore existing DB entries
Remove duplicates (generally we should now be duplicates free, but in case we're not)
- read all tags from flickr, compare sums and look for duplicates
- if found, fetch photos and present links (user will delete manually)
- auto delete option
Main run point:
- opt to login with a new user
- opt to delete cached users
General:
- pull/commit DB to git automatically
- move all initiations to main and use a constructor
- provide the DB handle from the @conf in main

-------------------



Database
--------
Key-Value store. Daybreak: http://propublica.github.io/daybreak/
DB File per account.

data:
1. Hash sum of the photo: string (MD5 Hex Digest. 32 hex chars)
2. Flickr photo id:       string
3. Dir path (relative to mount point) 'drive_name/photos/dir/subdir/subdir2' where 'drive_name' can be within /mnt/PC/drive_name/photos/...
   So later in time, you can mount the same drive to another mount point and not need to re-scan it all.
4. Last modification date of Dir


Schema:
-- key ---- | -- value -- | -- comment --
hash sum    |  flickr id  | Used for checking local photos we have
flickr id   |  hash sum   | Used for checking photos in flickr
* both are filled up when we (1) successfully upload a photo
  (2) update the hash sum of a photo from flickr
  The double entry is because I don't know how to index values in this db and this seems efficient enough
path/to/dir | dir_mod     | relative to mount point which is configureable, epoch time


1. When uploading, we first successfully upload the photo
   and only then store the photo id and hash.

2. When checking all photos in flickr, we get the photo id
   and then look for it in the db.

3. When a photo is deleted from flicker we won't be uploading
   it again since it's already in db. This is the desired behavior.
   We don't delete the photo id from flickr, it will never be used again.
